            <div class="cur">
                <p>1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and
                    one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fut">
                <p>2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</p>

                <p>3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of
                    oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of
                    all the men
                    of the east.</p>

                <P>4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their
                    three
                    sisters to eat and to drink with them.
                </P>

                <P>5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them,
                    and
                    rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for
                    Job
                    said,
                    It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
                </P>

                <p>6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came
                    also
                    among them.
                </p>

                <p>7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From
                    going
                    to
                    and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
                </p>

                <p>8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in
                    the-->
                    earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>

                <p>9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
                </p>

                <p>10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every
                    side?
                    thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>

                <p>11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>

                <p>12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put
                    not
                    forth
                    thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</p>

                <p>13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
                    brother's house:</p>

                <p>14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside
                    them:</p>

                <p>15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the
                    edge
                    of
                    the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>

                <p>16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from
                    heaven,
                    and
                    hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell
                    thee.</p>

                <p>17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands,
                    and
                    fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the
                    sword;
                    and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>

                <p>18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were
                    eating
                    and
                    drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</p>

                <p>19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house,
                    and it
                    fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>

                <p>20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and
                    worshipped,</p>

                <p>21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave,
                    and
                    the
                    LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</p>

                <p>22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

                <p>1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan
                    came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fut">
                <p>2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From
                    going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>

                <p>3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in
                    the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he
                    holdeth fast his integrity,although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</p>

                <p>4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his
                    life.</p>

                <p>5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy
                    face.</p>

                <p>6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</p>

                <p>7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of
                    his foot unto his crown.</p>

                <p>8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</p>

                <p>9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</p>

                <p>10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive
                    good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his
                    lips.</p>

                <p>11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one
                    from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for
                    they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</p>

                <p>12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and
                    wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</p>

                <p>13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto
                    him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>

            <div class="cur">
                <p>1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fut">
                <p>2 And Job spake, and said,</p>

                <p>3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child
                    conceived.</p>

                <p>4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon
                    it.</p>

                <p>5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the
                    day terrify it.</p>

                <p>6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let
                    it not come into the number of the months.</p>

                <p>7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</p>

                <p>8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</p>

                <p>9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it
                    see the dawning of the day:</p>

                <p>10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</p>

                <p>11 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</p>

                <p>12 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</p>

                <p>13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>

                <p>14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;</p>

                <p>15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>

                <p>16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</p>

                <p>17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</p>

                <p>18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</p>

                <p>19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</p>

                <p>20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</p>

                <p>21 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>

                <p>22 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>

                <p>23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>

                <p>24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>

                <p>25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto
                    me.</p>
                26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.

                <p>1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fut">
                <p>2 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from
                    speaking?</p>

                <p>3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>

                <p>4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>

                <p>5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>

                <p>6 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>

                <p>7 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>

                <p>8 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>

                <p>9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</p>

                <p>10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions,
                    are.broken.</p>

                <p>11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</p>

                <p>12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</p>

                <p>13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</p>

                <p>14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</p>

                <p>15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</p>

                <p>16 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there
                    was.silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</p>

                <p>17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>

                <p>18 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>

                <p>19 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which
                    are.crushed.before the moth?</p>

                <p>20 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</p>

                <p>21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</p>

                <p>8 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</p>

                <p>9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</p>

                <p>10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</p>

                <p>11 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</p>

                <p>12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their
                    enterprise.</p>

                <p>13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried
                    headlong.</p>

                <p>14 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</p>

                <p>15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</p>

                <p>16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>

                <p>17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of
                    the.Almighty:</p>

                <p>18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</p>

                <p>19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>

                <p>20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</p>

                <p>21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when
                    it.cometh.</p>

                <p>22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the
                    earth.</p>

                <p>23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be

                <p>24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation,

                <p>26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</p>

                <p>3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</p>

                <p>4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors
                    of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>

                <p>5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>

                <p>6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an
                    egg?</p>

                <p>7 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</p>

                <p>8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>

                <p>9 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>

                <p>10 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I
                    have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>

                <p>11 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</p>

                <p>12 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</p>

                <p>13 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p>

                <p>14 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the
                    Almighty.</p>

                <p>15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</p>

                <p>16 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</p>

                <p>17 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>

                <p>18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</p>

                <p>19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>

                <p>20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</p>

                <p>21 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</p>

                <p>22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</p>

                <p>23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</p>

                <p>24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>

                <p>25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</p>

                <p>26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</p>

                <p>27 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</p>

                <p>28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</p>

                <p>29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</p>

                <p>30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</p>

                        work:</p>

                    <p>3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>

                    <p>4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to
                        and fro unto the dawning of the day.</p>

                    <p>5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</p>

                    <p>6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>

                    <p>7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</p>

                    <p>8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am

                    <p>11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will
                        complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>

                    <p>12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</p>

                    <p>13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;</p>

                    <p>14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</p>

                    <p>15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</p>

                    <p>16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</p>

                    <p>17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon
                        him?</p>

                    <p>18 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</p>

                    <p>19 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>

                    <p>20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a
                        mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</p>

                    <p>21 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I
                        sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</p>

                    <p>12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</p>

                    <p>13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</p>

                    <p>14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</p>

                    <p>15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not
                        endure.</p>

                    <p>16 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</p>

                    <p>17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</p>

                    <p>18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</p>

                    <p>19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</p>

                    <p>20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</p>
